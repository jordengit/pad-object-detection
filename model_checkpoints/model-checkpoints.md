This folder is intentionally empty.

You should download and unpack the pretrained models that you want to retrain
into this directory. You can get them from:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

The models I've tested with are:
http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17.tar.gz
http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2017_11_08.tar.gz
