This document describes how to create a pipline training config:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/configuring_jobs.md

The 'templates' directory contains the original versions of the pipeline
configs directly copied out of the object_detection project here: 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs

The 'configured' directory contains adjusted versions of the sample configs,
update with your own values.
